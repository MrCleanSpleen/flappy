# Flappy HTML5 Phaser Game Template

Use this template to assemble your own game like Flappy Bird. Then, as
you learn more code, customize it to your liking.

## Fork

First fork this repo so you have one of your own:

## Clone

Now clone it someplace you can work on it. For most at SkilStak this
will be `skilstak.sh` but you could clone it to your own computer as
well:

## Add Your Art

This template does not come with any art. To add your own simply
create the art in the proper dimensions, which you can find in the
[source code](public/js), and save it in [`public\assets`](public/assets)
directory. [PiskelApp.com][] is a great tool to create your game
art.

## Our Stack

What is HTML5? It is the modern language used to create web pages
including those with moving parts and games. If you have heard of
Flash games then just know HTML5 has replaced Flash for pretty much
anything like it on the web.

* [Phaser.io][] - HTML5 JavaScript Game Framework based on Pixi 
* [Harp][] - No nonsense web server and site generation tool
* [Surge.sh][] - Free unlimited static web site hosting
* [PhoneGap][]\* - Free open source app builds

\* While we would prefer to use CocoonJS it is still not baked enough to
teach broadly and simply to students 8-18 years old.
